# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification with Machine Learning

This project is a classification application developed using the **Iris Dataset**, which is often considered the "Hello World" of machine learning. It predicts the flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on sepal and petal measurements.

## 🚀 Technologies & Libraries

* **Language:** Python
* **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, XGBoost
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 🧠 Models Implemented

The performance of the following algorithms was compared within the project:

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* XGBoost Classifier

## 📊 Results

In the tests performed on the dataset, most models achieved **100% (1.0)** accuracy. Model consistency was further observed using different `test_size` configurations and `cross_validation` techniques.

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost
    ```
3.  Run the `.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook file.
